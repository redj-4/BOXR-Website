                        <p>A proper boxing stance is crucial for balance, power, and defense. Here's how to perfect your stance:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Feet Position:</strong> Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Your lead foot (left for orthodox, right for southpaw) should be slightly forward.</li>
                            <li><strong>Weight Distribution:</strong> Distribute your weight evenly on the balls of your feet. This allows for quick movement in any direction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Knees:</strong> Keep your knees slightly bent. This aids in maintaining balance and allows for quick pivots.</li>
                            <li><strong>Torso:</strong> Turn your torso slightly to the side, presenting a smaller target to your opponent.</li>
                            <li><strong>Arms and Hands:</strong> Keep your hands up, protecting your chin. Elbows should be tucked in to protect your body.</li>
                            <li><strong>Head Position:</strong> Tuck your chin slightly to protect your jaw, but maintain sight of your opponent.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Practice this stance regularly until it feels natural. A solid stance is the foundation for all your boxing techniques.</p>

                        <p>Effective footwork is key to both offense and defense in boxing. Master these techniques:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Basic Step:</strong> Practice moving forward, backward, left, and right while maintaining your stance. Keep your feet about shoulder-width apart and never cross them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pivoting:</strong> Learn to pivot on your lead foot to quickly change angles. This is crucial for avoiding punches and setting up your own attacks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Circling:</strong> Move around your opponent by stepping with your lead foot and following with your rear foot. Practice circling both clockwise and counterclockwise.</li>
                            <li><strong>In-and-Out Movement:</strong> Quick steps in to attack and out to avoid counters. This keeps your opponent guessing and creates openings.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rhythm and Flow:</strong> Develop a smooth, continuous movement. Avoid bouncing or unnecessary movements that telegraph your intentions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Remember, good footwork should be effortless and efficient. Practice these movements daily to improve your overall boxing performance.</p>

                        <p>Master these four basic punches to build your boxing arsenal:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Jab:</strong> A quick, straight punch thrown with your lead hand. It's used to maintain distance, set up other punches, and gauge your opponent's reactions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Cross:</strong> A powerful straight punch thrown with your rear hand. It often follows the jab and can be a fight-ending punch when landed cleanly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Hook:</strong> A curved punch that can be thrown with either hand. It's particularly effective for hitting the side of the head or the body.</li>
                            <li><strong>Uppercut:</strong> An upward rising punch that targets the chin or body. It's especially useful in close-range fighting.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>When practicing these punches, focus on proper form, speed, and power. Always return your hand to your guard position after throwing a punch.</p>

                        <p>Combinations are sequences of punches that increase your offensive effectiveness. Here are some essential combinations to practice:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1-2 (Jab-Cross):</strong> The most basic and versatile combination. Use it to close distance and land a power punch.</li>
                            <li><strong>1-2-3 (Jab-Cross-Hook):</strong> A classic three-punch combination that can be devastating when landed cleanly.</li>
                            <li><strong>1-2-3-2 (Jab-Cross-Hook-Cross):</strong> This four-punch combo ends with a powerful cross, often catching opponents off guard.</li>
                            <li><strong>1-2-5-2 (Jab-Cross-Left Uppercut-Cross):</strong> Mix up your attack by incorporating an uppercut before finishing with a cross.</li>
                            <li><strong>3-2-3 (Hook-Cross-Hook):</strong> A powerful combination that works well when you're in close range.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Practice these combinations on a heavy bag, focusing on speed, power, and smooth transitions between punches. As you improve, try creating your own combinations.</p>

                        <p>A good defense is just as important as a strong offense. Master these defensive techniques:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Blocking:</strong> Use your gloves and arms to deflect incoming punches. Practice blocking jabs with your lead hand and crosses with your rear hand.</li>
                            <li><strong>Parrying:</strong> Redirect your opponent's punches by gently knocking them off course with your open hand. This can create openings for counter-attacks.</li>
                            <li><strong>Slipping:</strong> Move your head to the side to avoid straight punches. Practice slipping to both sides to avoid jabs and crosses.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rolling:</strong> Duck under hooks by bending your knees and rotating your upper body. This puts you in a good position to counter-attack.</li>
                            <li><strong>Footwork:</strong> Use your feet to move out of range or change angles, making it difficult for your opponent to land clean shots.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Remember, the best defense often sets up your next offensive move. Practice transitioning from defensive moves into counter-attacks.</p>
